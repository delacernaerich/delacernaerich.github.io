                            through this module or discussion I was educated about the computer, such as what does 
                            computing means, what are its purpose and what things can we say that computing occurs. 
                            Also, in this module as was able to present the idea about the tech timeline research 
                            where we are given a chance to discover the history of technology for more than years.

                            this chapter, as computers become even more pervasive, the potential for computer-related
                            careers will continue to grow and the career paths in computer-related fields will become
                            more diverse. This will include some of the careers: The career opportunities for the
                            graduates of computer-related courses can be classified into eight categories: programming
                            and software development, information systems operation and management, telecommunications
                            and networking, computer science research, graphics, and multimedia, web, and internet, and

                            and I wasnt able to determined the right thing to do as Im trying to understand the lessons well.
                            This lesson make me feel like Im not good in everything, like Im not good in undesrtanding this
                            kind of field. But I know that it is part of my journey as a student, cause Im just learning new 
                            things and I was thankful that despite all the challenges I've been through a lot while making
                            this final output, I would be bless that I was able to finished it in amidst of all.
